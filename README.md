# Reinforce learning

`This repository showcases an implementation of the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm applied to the classic snake game. `

It offers a comprehensive demonstration of how RL algorithms can be leveraged to train an intelligent agent to excel at this popular game.
In the training process of the Snake agent it learns to navigate the game board, collect food, and grow without colliding into itself or the boundaries.
